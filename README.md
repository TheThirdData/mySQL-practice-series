# mySQL-practice-series
Welcome to my SQL-based data analysis project. There are three projects and their corresponding dataset(where needed) in this repository. Each project aims to showcase various functions and querying abilities to derive useful information from each data.

ðŸ“Œ Tools Used
SQL (MySQL)

ðŸ§  What I Learned
SQL is not just for data retrieval. Itâ€™s a storytelling tool that can segment behavior, detect trends, and highlight insights that matter.This project deepened my understanding of how structured query language can be used not just to pull data but to tell powerful stories through logic and segmentation. It also sharpened my ability to combine advanced SQL functions in practical, business-relevant ways.

ðŸ’¼ Let's Collaborate
This is what I do, I help organisation extract valuable insights from their data using SQL and analytical thinking. If you're a company sitting on data but unsure how to leverage it for decision-making, I'm happy to help.

Letâ€™s connect.
